# Nested Node Modules Cleaner

**Nested Node Modules Cleaner** is a tool that removes all nested `node_modules` folders within a directory efficiently. Built using **Electron**, it provides a **GUI interface** to track progress and deletion information.

## Features

- Scans and detects all nested `node_modules` folders within a selected directory.
- Deletes detected folders using **PowerShell** and **Command Prompt (CMD)** as a fallback.
- Provides a **progress indicator** and logs deletion information.
- Simple and minimal **GUI interface**.

## How It Works

1. **Scans for node_modules folders** recursively inside the selected directory.
2. **Attempts to delete folders using PowerShell**:
   ```javascript
   const command = `Remove-Item -Path '${folder}' -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`;
   ```
3. If PowerShell fails, it **uses CMD as a fallback**:
   ```javascript
   const cmdCommand = `rd /s /q "\\?\${folder}"`;
   ```
4. Updates the user with **progress and logs**.
