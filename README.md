## Features

- Scans and detects all nested `node_modules` folders within a selected directory.
- Deletes detected folders using **PowerShell** and **Command Prompt (CMD)** as a fallback.
- Provides a **progress indicator** and logs deletion information.
- Simple and minimal **GUI interface**.

## Why Use This Tool?
### Deleting `node_modules` Manually is Slow
When deleting the `node_modules` folder using the **Windows File Explorer Delete button**, it takes much longer compared to using **PowerShell or CMD**. Here‚Äôs why:

1. **Windows Explorer Checks Every File:**
   - It scans and calculates file sizes and types before deletion.
   - Moves files to the **Recycle Bin**, adding extra processing time.

2. **Too Many Small Files:**
   - `node_modules` contains thousands (or even millions) of files.
   - Windows struggles with deleting many small files quickly.

3. **File System Overhead:**
   - Windows Explorer deletes files one at a time, refreshing the UI, causing extra delay.

### Why CMD or PowerShell is Faster
1. **Bypasses Recycle Bin** ‚Üí Directly removes files, skipping extra steps.
2. **Efficient Bulk Deletion** ‚Üí Deletes entire directories at once.
3. **No UI Overhead** ‚Üí No progress bars or file scanning.


## How It Works

1. **Scans for node_modules folders** recursively inside the selected directory.
2. **Attempts to delete folders using PowerShell**:
   ```javascript
   const command = `Remove-Item -Path '${folder}' -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`;
   ```
3. If PowerShell fails, it **uses CMD as a fallback**:
   ```javascript
   const cmdCommand = `rd /s /q "\\?\${folder}"`;
   ```
4. Updates the user with **progress and logs**.
